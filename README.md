<h1>Pokedex API</h1>

<p>This is the API for my  full stack Pokedex application. This C.R.U.D. application is a library of pokemon. Users (trainers) can  create new pokemon, see pokemon,  update their names, or release them into the wild (delete them).</p>

<h1>About this API</h1>

<p>Here is the back end API for the pokedex application. The back end of this app was built with
Ruby on Rails.

I wanted to build an application that would be game inspired as I am interested in pursuing a career in the game industry after completing the Software Immersive program.

This app allows you to sign up and sign in with an email and password. After signing in you can interact with the pokedex by creating, updating, deleting and getting all the pokemon you created in the application.

Ruby on Rails allowed me to add a feature where I was able to only allow users to look at their own data and not other people's data.

In future iterations of this project I plan on improving the design so it emulates the design of the pokedex used in the cartoon "Pokemon". As well as the design of the application I will add a feature where the user can search for a single pokemon by name and the app will find that pokemon by id and retrieve the data for the user with a picture of the pokemon and a description of the pokemon in the middle of the application.
